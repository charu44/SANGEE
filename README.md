# SANGEE
The amount of stress and anxiousness is increasing more than ever among 
students. The rate of depression and cases of cyberbullying is also 
increasingly alarming regularly. Students are constantly felling a sense of 
loneliness and loosing contact with their friends due to this havoc in their 
mind. Most of the Institutions don't have any dedicated faculty or counsellor to 
help out their students who are going through these kind of problems and they 
can't even discuss it with their family as well. This leads to bottelled up 
feelings and hence can lead to destructive results. So would not it be amazing 
and comforting to share your thoughts with someone who is ready to listen to 
you without judging you and seek their guidance. That is what SANGEE is 
about. It provides you variety of features including verified counsellors, access 
to many informative and motivating live sessions and blogs. Another feature is 
Innerhour that will allow you to find unique approches to help you yourself only.
